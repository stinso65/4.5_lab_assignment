        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I first became interested in UX design while working at the Center Point Public Library as a Library Assistant. It was a daily occurrence that patrons of varying ages and backgrounds struggled with using applications on their phones or desktop computers.
          Since then, I've enrolled in the Master of Science in User Experience (UXMS) program at Michigan State University. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and always looking for new challenges to expand my skills. When I'm not designing, you can find me crocheting, watching Shounen anime, or exploring new places. </p>
